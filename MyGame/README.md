### Description of the game

Our project tried to mimic the classic Neogeo game Fatal Fury, our alpha contains the three playable characters, Joe, Terry and Andy, also three playable maps. the gameplay is based on a 1v1 mode where the player1 selects one of the three main characters and competes against player2 that uses Terry with another skin. 
The game has the basic mechanics of a 2D fighting game.
