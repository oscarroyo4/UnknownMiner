## My project website

#### This website was created to give a preview of my project about Unkonwn Miner
During these months I have been working on a videogame project  for the subject of videogame development. First I learned to use Tiled and later I have learned to save and load the information from a xml file. Finally I developed the videogame step by step.

### Description of the game

My project is a Sidescroller plataformer where a player is a miner who moves forward to complete two levels. He can only jump 1 height but with the help of the pickaxe he can jump up to 3 blocks, you have to hit with it in the air in order to make this big jump. You can't move in mid air, only if you use the second jump so be carefull when you fall down.

### Controlls
 * A - Walk forward   
 * D - Walk backwards
 * Space - First jump
 * E - If the player is on the ground he hits with the pickaxe, if he is in the air he makes the second jump.
 * F1 - Go to the first map
 * F2 - Go to the second map
 * F3 - Reset level
 * F5 - Save current status
 * F6 - Load last status
 * F9 - Show colliders
 *F10 - God Mode (You don't collide with anything and you can fly everywhere)
